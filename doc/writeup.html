            <h3>Rationale for my design decisions</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of this visualization is to show the relationship
                between clinic/provider
                access and the out-of-state abortion rate. I decided to use a
                choropleth map of the
                United States with two sliders because this format makes it easy
                to see geographic
                patterns. The map helps show which regions have lower access,
                and the sliders let
                users filter states based on clinic and provider access levels.

            <h3>Development process</h3>
            <p>
                I worked on this project by myself, and it took me around 12
                hours to finish. I spent
                some time choosing the topic and thinking about how to represent
                the data in a clear
                and simple way.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had trouble at first finding the correct source for the United
                States geographic map data.
                After I found the right file, I did some data cleaning,
                including mapping state names to FIPS codes.
                I then added two sliders as interactive elements. These sliders
                work as thresholds
                and highlight states whose clinic and provider access fall below
                the values
                selected by the user. I experimented with both "OR" and "AND"
                filtering, and in the end I chose
                the "AND" version because it shows states with consistently low
                access in both measures.
